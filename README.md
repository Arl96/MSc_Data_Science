# MSc_Data_Science
This repository was created so that I could share any assignments, coursework, and projects which I have undertaken in the course of my MSc data Science course at Loughborough University.
I will update regularly throughout the duration of my course, which runs from October 2020 to October 2021.

Each folder in this repository represents a module which I completed and contains the coursework I completed for this module

My grades for the courseworks for each module are as follows:
Introduction to Data Science: **95.75/100**
